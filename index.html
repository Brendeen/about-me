    <p class="main-p">Hey! My name is Brenden Moore, Welcome to my page! </p>

    <p class="main-p">I live in and have grown up in Washington state for a majority of my life, though i was born in California. Im a super nerdy person and i love all things anime and video game related! When im outside i love to skateboard and hangout with my buddies.</p>

    <p class="main-p">Im 19 years old and graduated from high school in 2021. Im currently a student at code fellows learning about software development. Im employed at Albertons Safeway currently and have about a year and a half of customer service and produce experience.</p>

    <p class="main-p">Some goals I have for myself are to graduate code fellows and get a well paying and interesting job in the tech industry. But some more personal goals i have for myself are things like go on more walks and pick up video editing again.</p>
